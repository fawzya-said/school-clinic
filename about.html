            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>School-based health care is a powerful tool for achieving health equity among children and adolescents who unjustly experience disparities in outcomes simply because of their race, ethnicity, family income, or where they live. It’s an idea that has gained currency across the country: place critically needed services like medical, behavioral, dental, and vision care directly in schools so that all young people, no matter their ZIP code, have an equal opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>At the School-Based Health Alliance, we’ve worked for over 25 years to:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
         <li>Advance national policy and legislative priorities for the field</li>
         <li>Advocate for greater support and funding</li>
         <li>Promote high-quality clinical practices and standards</li>
         <li>Support data collection and reporting, evaluation, and research</li>
         <li>Provide training, technical assistance, and consultation</li>

            <li><p>Cross-sector collaboration, systems of care, and supports to create equitable opportunity for learning and health to all children—no matter their race, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, gender, sexual orientation, ability, or ZIP code—are critical to achieving health care equity;</p></li>
            <li><p>By working together, our schools, public health authorities, healthcare systems and providers, youth and family services, law enforcement and juvenile courts, community development institutions, interfaith and civil rights groups have the collective power to remediate the effects of detrimental social, environmental, and economic factors (also called root causes) on children’s health and academic success;</p></li>
            <li><p>When communities engage students and their families as active stakeholders, leaders, and change-makers in comprehensive, school-centered strategies, they can make every school a place of safety, belonging, connectedness, and limitless opportunity.</p></li>
